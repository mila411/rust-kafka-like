//! # pilgrimage
//!
//! This is a Rust implementation of a distributed messaging system.
//! It uses a simple design inspired by [Apache Kafka][Kafka].
//! It simply records messages to local files.
//!
//! Current Pilgrimage supports **At-least-once**.
//!
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! When using Pilgramage as a Crate, client authentication is implemented,
//! but at present, authentication is not implemented for message sending
//! and receiving from the CLI and web client.
//! You can find a sample of authentication with Crate
//! [examples/auth-example.rs][auth-example.rs], [examples/auth-send-recv.rs][auth-send-recv.rs].
//!
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Topic-based pub/sub model
//! - Scalability through partitioning
//! - Persistent messages (log file based)
//! - Leader/Follower Replication
//! - Fault Detection and Automatic Recovery
//! - Delivery guaranteed by acknowledgement (ACK)
//! - Fully implemented leader selection mechanism
//! - Partition Replication
//! - Persistent messages
//! - Schema Registry for managing message schemas and ensuring compatibility
//! - Automatic Scaling
//! - Broker Clustering
//! - Message processing in parallel
//! - Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
//! - Data Encryption
//! - CLI based console
//! - WEB based console
